# Reaction Knowledge Graph Processor: rxn_rdf_converter

## Overview

The ``rxn_rdf_converter`` is a Python package which aims to process reaction data stored in Google Protocol Buffers with the Open Reaction Database (ORD) schema into **a knowledge graph representation** as **Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples** using **MDS-Onto** (a domain ontology for Materials Data Science) as the semantic model.

This package facilitates the transformation of raw experimental data into structured RDF triples (Turtle or JSON-LD format), making the data semantically searchable, linkable, and machine-readable for advanced data analysis and machine learning applications in chemistry and materials science.

## Motivation

We built this package to streamline the data integration of reaction/synthesis data into one centralized database with formulation, manufacturing, and degradation.

The bottleneck of mapping reaction data to an ontology can be tedious and error-prone. Thus, this package hopefully will provide an automated tool to reduce the time needed to integrate data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* The `ord-schema` library.
* The `owlready2` library for ontology handling.
* The `rdflib` library for RDF graph generation.
* **RDKit** for chemical identifier normalization (InChIKey, SMILES conversion).

### Setup
Install the required dependencies using pip

## Package Usage

The package will convert a dataset (that contains hundreds to thousands of reactions) in ORD schema in Google Protocol Buffers format into Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples in JSON-LD or Turtle format using MDS-Onto as the semantic model. 

The core workflow involves initializing a DatasetProcessor to manage logging and file paths, and then iterating over its reactions using the ReactionKG class to build the individual knowledge graphs (Turtle or JSON-LD serialization format).

The package is capable of batch processing multiple datasets or only one dataset. In addition, using the ReactionKG class, a user can generate one single reaction at a time. 


---
## Limitation

This package currently only works for reaction data in ORD schema and MDS-Onto is passed as an argument. It will not work with data in other Google Protocol Buffer schemas or other ontologies. 

If a user has more than 50 datasets (each contains hundreds to thousands of reactions), running the package to process multiple datasets will cause a crash since there is not enough in-memory storage. The multiple-dataset batch processing was designed to run on distributed, parallel computing infrastructure with Hadoop ecosystem.
